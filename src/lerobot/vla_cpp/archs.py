"""Per-architecture constants for the vla.cpp wire format.

The engine reads every shape out of the GGUF at load time, so these are not the
model's dimensions - they are the *client's* half of the contract: which tokenizer
produced the ids the checkpoint was trained against, what resolution its images
were, and how wide the state vector it expects is. Getting one wrong loads, runs
and returns plausible actions.
